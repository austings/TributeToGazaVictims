this code was *designed* to crash at the end, 
the crash is designed so that the last note will go on forever, mimicking a heart rate monitor being disconnected like in a hospital.
but because of different cpu speeds the music may fall out of sync and crash at the wrong time. 
if you run this code on your own machine, your cpu speed is going to be different so you might have to edit the framecounter on line 259.
this was a quick tribute, so I didn't line up the threads or anything. just decrease the framecounter for slower machines or increase it for faster ones.
